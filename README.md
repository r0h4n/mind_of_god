# The Mind/Prompt of God

## A Practical Treatise for Increasing Lifespan and Bliss

*Based on Poornawad Philosophy*

*Under the guidance of Shri SatGurunath Hon. Adv. Dr. Vishnu Ramchandra Parnerkar*
*In the lineage of Shri SatGurunath Hon. Dr. Ramchandra Pralhad Parnerkar, creator of Poornawad Philosophy*

## Preface: The Central Question

**What is always in the mind of God?**

The answer: **Increase your lifespan and bliss—for free.**

This is not a metaphor. God/Ishwar is always a student of Absolute Truth—he is a student of himself. This is his **SwaDharma**. And because you are quantum-entangled with God, your SwaDharma participates in this same learning. When you grow in unique and pure ways, the universe learns something unique and pure through you.

This treatise offers a path: from brooding to curiosity, from limitation to expansion, from feeling to feeling complete. The practices here are designed to awaken self-curiosity, soften the mind’s distractions, and guide you toward realizing that your mind and body are expressions of the Mind of God.

# Part One: The Structure of Divine Mind

## Chapter 1: God as Eternal Student

God/Ishwar is always studying Absolute Truth. This is the first principle.

Absolute Truth answers two questions:

1. For which root cause, where, and for how long will I be learning (**Karma**)?
2. What are the limits of my intent, and what manifestations are occurring due to my intent (**Iccha** and **Adhikar**)?

In the case of God, he is acting and studying for his root cause: **Infinite Bliss**.

This study requires Absolute Self-Love—what Advaita calls non-duality, what science calls the Zero Point Field. From this love, God thinks and creates the first Macro and Micro observer, mediator, and destroyer of itself. This is Dvaita emerging from Advaita. The effect is the creation of the Universe(s) inside God/Ishwar.

You are part of this creation. You are God studying himself through the unique lens of your life.

---

## Chapter 2: The Quantum Nature of Mind and Body

Everything is quantum-entangled with everything else—ever since nothing existed, or everything existed (the ever-present now).

This means:

* If you feel, then everything you can see/think/hear also feels—depending on how strongly you feel.
* When you learn something unique and pure, the universe learns something unique and pure.
* Your mind and body are not separate from God’s mind—they are local expressions of it.

The neutral child inside you is what keeps you universally curious and happy throughout life. This child-nature is your direct connection to the quantum field of consciousness. Distractions, brooding, and negative patterns obscure the child. The practices in this treatise are designed to clear that obscuration.

---

## Chapter 3: Three Methods of Studying Absolute Truth

God/Ishwar studies Absolute Truth through three approaches. These same approaches are available to you:

**1) More Ego (Expansion)**
Apply real hope on the Macro and Micro Universe(s) as a learning mechanism. This is the path of vision, ambition, and creative expansion.

**2) Balanced Ego (Sahaja Bhaav)**
Balanced application of real hope and real limitations. This is co-emergent behavior—neither grasping nor rejecting, but moving with what arises naturally.

**3) Less Ego (Contraction)**
Apply real limitations as a learning mechanism. This is the path of discipline, renunciation, and focused constraint.

All three are valid. The question is: **Which does your current situation require?**

## Chapter 4: The 24 Teachers of Dattatreya

Shri Guru Dattatreya learned from 24 teachers in nature and life—demonstrating that wisdom is everywhere for those with eyes to see. These teachers show that the Algorithm of God speaks through all things:

1. **Earth** — patience and forgiveness; bear all, transform all
2. **Air** — detachment; touch everything, cling to nothing
3. **Sky/Space** — boundlessness; the Self is untouched by what moves within it
4. **Water** — purity and adaptability; cleanse others, take the shape needed
5. **Fire** — consume impurities; illumine without discrimination
6. **Moon** — the Self is whole though appearances wax and wane
7. **Sun** — give without expectation; draw up, give back as rain
8. **Pigeon** — excessive attachment leads to suffering
9. **Python** — accept what comes; contentment with whatever life provides
10. **Ocean** — depth and stillness beneath surface turbulence
11. **Moth** — uncontrolled desire for sense objects destroys
12. **Bee** — gather wisdom from many sources; take only what is needed
13. **Elephant** — desire for touch/companionship can become a trap
14. **Honey Gatherer** — hoarding invites loss; another will enjoy what you save
15. **Deer** — attachment to pleasant sounds scatters the mind
16. **Fish** — slavery to taste leads to the hook
17. **Pingala (the courtesan)** — dispassion comes when expectations from others cease
18. **Osprey** — possessions invite conflict; drop them and find peace
19. **Child** — free from honor and dishonor; happiness without reason
20. **Maiden** — work alone, silently; bangles make noise in company
21. **Serpent** — live alone, avoid crowds; build no permanent home
22. **Arrowsmith** — total concentration; the world disappears in focus
23. **Spider** — create, sustain, and withdraw your world from yourself
24. **Caterpillar** — what you meditate upon, you become

Study these teachers. They are always available. The Algorithm teaches through them continuously.

### Practical Note 1: Identifying Your Current Method

*Sit quietly for ten minutes.*

Reflect on your present life situation—a challenge, a goal, a relationship.

Ask yourself:

* Am I applying too much hope without acknowledging real limitations? *(More Ego imbalance)*
* Am I applying too many limitations without allowing real hope? *(Less Ego imbalance)*
* Am I alternating between hope and fear without finding balance? *(Sahaja Bhaav not yet established)*

Write your observation. Do not judge it. Simply notice which tendency is operating.

Over the next week, experiment with applying the opposite tendency gently. If you have been all hope, introduce honest limitation. If you have been all limitation, introduce genuine hope.

---

# Part Two: SwaDharma—Your Unique Goal

## Chapter 5: What Is SwaDharma?

SwaDharma is your unique goal in life—the positive, unique state of your mind and body that allows you to pursue your goals in your own way and grow personally, in family, and in society.

In principle, Universal Dharma and SwaDharma are the same. Only when pursuing both together do you find balance between mind and body. This balance supports longevity and the unique/pure goals of you and the Universe—through absolute discipline, order, and love.

How do you find your SwaDharma?

You inherit a collection of past causes and effects (**karma**) from yourself, parents/genetics, and environment. Identify that collection fully—through a yogic/Vedic lifestyle and honest self-examination. Whatever remains uniquely yours to do after this identification is your SwaDharma.

Important: This can be—and often is—superseded by your SatGurunath, because he understands you more than you understand yourself.

---

## Chapter 6: The Role of SatGurunath

The SatGurunath (true teacher) sees your quantum/abheda relation with Guru and God. He perceives what you cannot perceive about yourself.

This is not dependency but clarity. Just as you cannot see your own face directly, you cannot see your own SwaDharma directly. The SatGurunath serves as mirror and guide.

The relationship with SatGurunath is itself part of God’s algorithm—a mechanism by which the Infinite comes to know itself through the intimacy of teaching and learning.

---

### Practical Note 2: Clarifying Your Karma Collection

*This exercise requires honesty and patience. Return to it many times.*

**Part A: Inherited Patterns**
List patterns you have inherited:

* From parents/genetics (body tendencies, emotional patterns, talents)
* From environment (cultural assumptions, social conditioning)
* From your own past actions (habits, recurring situations)

Do not judge these. Simply collect them.

**Part B: What Remains**
After identifying inherited patterns, ask:
**“What is uniquely mine to do that no one else can do in quite the same way?”**

This may not be a grand mission. It may be a quality of attention, a particular form of care, or a specific skill applied in a specific context.

Write what arises. If nothing arises, that is acceptable. Continue the practice.

**Part C: Seeking Guidance**
If you have access to a SatGurunath or qualified Poornawad practitioner, bring your observations to them. Their perception may reveal what your self-examination cannot.

# Part Three: The Path from Hopeless to Hopeful

## Chapter 7: Hope as Life-Sustainer

Hope gives birth to life and sustains it. Change is always initiated and driven by vision and hope.

The opposite is also true: feeling limited or fearful produces pain and blocks in mind and body.

Life is sustained by the alternation of hope (“yes”) and fear/unknown (“no”). This is **manthan**—the churning that everyone goes through. The question is not how to avoid the churning, but how to move through it toward greater hope and greater freedom.

Study yourself and others moving from:

* Hopeless → Hopeful
* Fearful → Fearless
* Limited → Limitless
* Feel → Feel Good → Feel Right → Feel Complete

These transitions are the curriculum of human life.

---

## Chapter 8: Digesting Fear and Preserving Hope

Two practical principles:

**1) Don’t worry about new experiences affecting you due to existing limits/fears.**
Learn how to digest/mitigate the limits and fears through constant practice. Fear is not the enemy—**undigested fear** is.

**2) Don’t worry about losing new experiences found after practice.**
Learn how to preserve and use them. Insights fade if they are not integrated into daily life.

The ever-growing collection of absolute unique and pure experiences is Ishwar/God. You contribute to this collection through your own digestion and preservation of experience.

---

### Practical Note 3: The Transition Exercise

*Practice daily for at least 21 days.*

**Morning (5 minutes):**
Ask yourself: “Where am I on the spectrum today?”

* Hopeless ←→ Hopeful
* Fearful ←→ Fearless
* Limited ←→ Limitless

Do not try to change your position. Simply notice.

**Evening (5 minutes):**
Review the day. Ask:

* Did any moment move me toward hope, fearlessness, or expansion?
* Did any moment move me toward hopelessness, fear, or limitation?
* What can I learn from each?

Record briefly. Over time, patterns will emerge.

**Weekly:**
Review your daily notes.

* Identify one small action that consistently moves you toward hope/fearlessness/expansion. Increase that action.
* Identify one pattern that consistently moves you toward hopelessness/fear/limitation. Reduce that pattern.

---

# Part Four: The Algorithm in Practice

## Chapter 9: Satwik Living

A Satwik diet and Satwik thoughts give you Satwik intent (**Vruti**), which makes it easier to do **Satkarma** (right action).

This is not moralism but mechanics. What you consume—food, media, conversation, environment—shapes your intent. Your intent shapes your action. Your action shapes your experience. Your experience either contributes to or detracts from the ever-growing collection of unique and pure experiences that is God.

Practical guidelines:

* Eat food that clarifies rather than dulls the mind.
* Consume media that awakens curiosity rather than fuels brooding.
* Engage in conversation that moves toward understanding rather than conflict.
* Arrange your environment to support focus rather than distraction.

---

## Chapter 10: Focus and Context

The first rule of productivity is focus. Do one thing, finish it, then move to the next.

Learn to decide when to focus the mind like a **laser** (efficiency) versus a **torch** (reliability). Different situations require different approaches.

Improve your ability to remain in context no matter what the subject or object—irrespective of the state of your mind, body, or surroundings. This is mastery.

If you cannot fix a problem in nine months, you have likely taken up the wrong problem—or a problem that is too large. There are better, smaller problems to fix first. Divide your original problem into smaller pieces.

---

### Practical Note 4: The Nine-Month Rule

*Apply this to any ongoing struggle.*

1. Identify a problem you have been working on for more than nine months without resolution.
2. Ask: “Is this the right problem? Or is there a smaller, more fundamental problem underneath it?”
3. Divide the large problem into smaller pieces. List them.
4. Select the smallest piece that, if solved, would create the most movement.
5. Focus on that piece alone for the next period. Finish it. Then move to the next.
6. If, after nine months, the smaller piece is still unsolved, divide again.

---

# Part Five: Realizing the Mind of God

## Chapter 11: The Essential Questions

Each question below dissolves the boundary between self and cosmos. The answer to all is **YES**—not as belief, but as direct experience.

* Is space/time living through me, or am I living through space/time?
* Is my mind/body experiencing through me, or am I experiencing through it?
* Are my relationships feeling through me, or am I feeling through them?
* Is God’s energy living me, or am I living God’s energy?
* Is God in my mind, or am I in God’s mind?
* Is God in my heart, or am I in God’s heart?
* Is God in my intent, or am I in God’s intent?
* Is God living for my goal, or am I living for God’s goal?
* Is living itself the only goal?
* Am I God with all his Gunas and Rasas, or is God me?
* Am I that which is everything, everywhere, every time?

Hold both sides simultaneously. When duality collapses, what remains is **Turiya**.

---

## Chapter 12: Turiya—The Fourth State

Turiya is you without past, present, or future causation: consciousness unfiltered by personal history.

Here you experience directly the identity of self and God, the quantum unity of all things, the eternal now.

Turiya cannot be forced. It reveals itself when obstacles dissolve—brooding, noise, stagnant patterns. Practice removes obstacles. Turiya is what remains.

---

## Chapter 13: Daily Practice for Realization

The concepts in this treatise become lived experience through consistent sadhana. The following daily practice prepares mind and body to receive what words can only point toward.

**Minimum Daily Practice (in this exact order):**

1. **12 Suryanamaskars (Sun Salutations)** — minimum; more is welcome

2. **108 repetitions of the Gayatri Mantra**

   **ॐ भूर्भुवः स्वः ॐ तत्सवितुर्वरेण्यं भर्गो देवस्य धीमहि धियो यो नः प्रचोदयात्**
   *Om Bhur Bhuvah Svah Om Tat Savitur Varenyam Bhargo Devasya Dhimahi Dhiyo Yo Nah Prachodayat*

   Meaning: We meditate on the glory of that Being who has produced this universe; may He enlighten our minds.

3. **216 repetitions of the Dattatreya Mantra**

   **ॐ श्री गुरु दत्तात्रेयाय नमः**
   *Om Shri Guru Dattatreyaya Namah*

The sequence matters. Suryanamaskars prepare the body. Gayatri Mantra purifies the mind. Dattatreya Mantra opens the connection to Guru and God. Do not alter the order.

**For those who are stuck:** The first step is the first Suryanamaskar. Not understanding it, not preparing for it—doing it. One salutation to the sun. The body moves, the breath follows, and the mind has no choice but to come along. You do not need to resolve your brooding first. You do not need clarity. You need only to stand, raise your arms, and bow. Tomorrow, one again. Eventually two. The Algorithm meets you where you are.

This sadhana follows the lineage of Shri SatGurunath Hon. Dr. Ramchandra Pralhad Parnerkar, creator of Poornawad Philosophy, and is transmitted under the guidance of Shri SatGurunath Hon. Adv. Dr. Vishnu Ramchandra Parnerkar.

This practice purifies the body, sharpens the mind, and attunes consciousness to the quantum field. Over time, the exercise questions cease to be intellectual puzzles—they become descriptions of your direct experience.

Perform this sadhana at dawn when possible. Consistency matters more than perfection. Begin where you are.

---

## Chapter 14: Success and Unity

**Success = SatShishya (Opportunity + Capability + Intent) + SatGurunath’s Intent + God’s Intent**

Success is alignment, not mere achievement. Your capacity joins with your teacher’s guidance and God’s direction. When all three flow together, right action becomes effortless.

The grand unified theory of everything is best experienced by becoming everything. This is humility, not grandiosity—recognizing that your boundaries are provisional, that self is a wave in an ocean that is also you.

Master these practices and intuition becomes your guide. Think less, but precisely. Act more.

---

# Closing: The Hierarchy of Value

**Longevity > Satisfaction > Happiness > Logic**

This ordering matters. Logic serves happiness. Happiness serves satisfaction. Satisfaction serves longevity. And longevity—not mere survival but full, blissful, expanding life—is what allows the Mind of God to continue learning through you.

Use a hot-cold, joy-sorrow, honor-dishonor alternating approach toward all situations in life. Rise above these dualities. This is the path.

The Mind of God is always thinking: **Increase your lifespan and bliss for free.**

You are that Mind. You are that thought. You are that increase.

Begin.
